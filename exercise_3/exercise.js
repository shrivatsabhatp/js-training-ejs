/* 1
Write a function called nestedSum that takes an array of arrays of integers 
and adds up the elements from all of the nested arrays. For example:

>>> let t = [[1, 2], [3], [4, 5, 6]];
>>> nestedSum(t)
21

*/

/* 2
Write a function called cumulativeSum that takes an array of numbers and 
returns the cumulative sum; that is, a new array where the ith element is the sum of the first i+1 elements 
from the original array. For example:

>>> let t = [1, 2, 3]
>>> cumulativeSum(t)
[1, 3, 6]
*/

/* 3
Write a function called middle that takes an array and returns a new array that contains 
all but the first and last elements. For example:

>>> let t = [1, 2, 3, 4]
>>> middle(t)
[2, 3]
*/

/* 4
Write a function called chop that takes an array , modifies it by removing the first and last elements, 
and returns undefined. 

For example:
>>>let t = [1, 2, 3, 4]
>>> chop(t)
>>> t
[2, 3]
*/

/* 5
Write a function called isSorted that takes a list as a parameter and returns true if the list is sorted in ascending order 
and false otherwise. For example:

>>> isSorted([1, 2, 2])
true
>>> isSorted(['b', 'a'])
false
*/

/* 6
Two words are anagrams if you can rearrange the letters from one to spell the other.
 Write a function called isAnagram that takes two strings and returns true if they are anagrams.
 */

/* 7
 Write a function called hasDuplicates that takes an array and returns true 
 if there is any element that appears more than once. It should not modify the original array.
 */

/* 8
 A word is said to be a “doubloon” if every letter that appears in the word appears exactly twice. 
 Here are some example doubloons found in the dictionary:

Abba, Anna, appall, appearer, appeases, arraigning, beriberi, bilabial, boob, Caucasus, coco, 
Dada, deed, Emmett, Hannah, horseshoer, intestines, Isis, mama, Mimi, murmur, noon, Otto, papa, 
peep, reappear, redder, sees, Shanghaiings, Toto
Write a function called isDoubloon that takes a string and checks whether it is a doubloon. 
To ignore case, invoke the toLowerCase method before checking.
 */

/* 9
A word is said to be “abecedarian” if the letters in the word appear in alphabetical order. 
For example, the following are all six-letter English abecedarian words:

abdest, acknow, acorsy, adempt, adipsy, agnosy, befist, behint, beknow, 
bijoux, biopsy, cestuy, chintz, deflux, dehors, dehort, deinos, diluvy, dimpsy
Write a function called isAbecedarian that takes a String and returns a boolean indicating whether the word is abecedarian
